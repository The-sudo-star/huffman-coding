hey this is just a test file for my huffman coding project

so basically im testing if this compression thing actually works lol
professor said we could do this for extra credit and i figured why not

lets see if it compresses this text... hoping for at least SOME compression
im writing random stuff here to make the file longer

the more i write the better the compression should be i think?
repeated letters should help: eeeeeeeeee tttttttt aaaaaaa

ok thats probably enough for a small test file
